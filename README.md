Welcome to **SOLIDER**! SOLIDER is a Semantic Controllable Self-Supervised Learning Framework to learn general human representations from massive unlabeled human images which can benefit downstream human-centric tasks to the maximum extent. Unlike the existing self-supervised learning methods, prior knowledge from human images is utilized in SOLIDER to build pseudo semantic labels and import more semantic information into the learned representation. Meanwhile, different downstream tasks always require different ratios of semantic information and appearance information, and a single learned representation cannot fit for all requirements. To solve this problem, SOLIDER introduces a conditional network with a semantic controller, which can fit different needs of downstream tasks. For more details, please refer to our paper [Beyond Appearance: a Semantic Controllable Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Human-Centric Visual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17602).

## Installation
This codebase has been developed with python version 3.7, PyTorch version 1.7.1, CUDA 10.1 and torchvision 0.8.2.                                           

## Datasets
We use **LUPerson** as our training data, which consists of unlabeled human images. Download **LUPerson** from its [offical link](https://github.com/DengpanFu/LUPerson) and unzip it.

## Training
- Choice 1. To train SOLIDER from scratch, please run:
```shell
sh run_solider.sh
```

- Choice 2. Training SOLIDER from scratch may take a long time. To speed up the training, you can train a DINO model first, and then finetune it with SOLIDER, as follows:
```shell
sh run_dino.sh
sh resume_solider.sh
```

## Finetuning and Inference
There is a demo to run the trained SOLIDER model, which can be embedded into the inference or the downstream task finetuning.
```shell
python demo.py
```

## Models
We use [Swin-Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer) as our backbone, which shows great advantages on many CV tasks.
